Game Rules

# The Dice Game follows these simple rules:

1. The game is played between two players, and each player takes turns.
2. On a player's turn, they can roll the dice by clicking the "Roll Dice" button.
3. The dice shows a random number from 1 to 6 upon rolling.
4. If a player rolls any number other than 1, that number is added to their current score.
5. The player can continue to roll the dice as many times as they want in a single turn to accumulate more points.
6. If a player rolls a 1, their current score becomes 0, and their turn ends. The turn then switches to the other player.
7. During their turn, a player can click the "Hold" button to save their current score to their total score.
8. The first player to reach the predetermined winning score (e.g., 100 points) wins the game.
